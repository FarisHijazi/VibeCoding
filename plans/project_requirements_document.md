# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The AcceptanceGate API is a RESTful service built to manage and automate the entire acceptance certification process for regulatory systems in Saudi Arabia. It handles various certification types like Technical Regulations, Energy, Water, Halal, Saudi Code, and Laboratory certifications. Designed as a centralized platform, the API ensures that all steps—from certificate request submission to final approval and issuance—are processed efficiently while maintaining full regulatory compliance.

The system is being built to streamline workflows between different user groups such as government officials, business administrators, and other organizations. By automating review steps and ensuring that all necessary information such as applicant details, regulatory data, and employee qualifications are captured accurately, the API improves transparency, reduces administrative overhead, and guarantees adherence to Saudi regulatory requirements. The key objectives are to simplify the certificate management process, reduce manual errors, and provide traceable and auditable data storage for future reference.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A RESTful API that accepts certificate requests and initiates the full workflow from submission to issuance.
*   Modules for managing various certification types: Technical Regulations, Energy, Water, Halal, Saudi Code, and Laboratory.
*   A detailed request lifecycle including applicant details, regulatory data, approval history, dates, and employee qualification information.
*   User workflows that include initial submission, administrative review with feedback (returning incomplete requests), followed by government officials' final approval and certificate issuance.
*   Integration capabilities designed for potential future connections, such as with the Saudi Business Center (integration itself is not active for the current version).

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Direct integration with the Saudi Business Center at this time.
*   Advanced analytics or reporting features beyond audit trails and basic logging.
*   Complex UI design and frontend components; this document focuses solely on the API backend.
*   Extensive role management beyond the defined workflow (i.e., roles are strictly defined as submitter, admin, and government official).

## 3. User Flow

A new user starts by accessing the API and retrieves a list of available technical regulations. The user selects the desired option from the list and proceeds to the accreditation summary stage. Here, the system provides the necessary details, and the user uploads the required attachments and accreditation files. After ensuring all documentation is in order, the user fills out the qualification information for the entity's employees and submits the request.

Once the submission is complete, the certificate request is sent to an administrator for review. If the administrator finds any missing or incorrect information, the request is returned to the user with specific feedback for corrections. When the submission meets all criteria, the administrator approves it and forwards the request to the appropriate government official. The government official then reviews the final submission, and upon satisfaction, confirms the request, leading to the generation and issuance of the final certificate.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Certificate Request Submission:**

    *   Ability for users to retrieve a lookup list of technical regulations.
    *   Selection and initialization of certification types such as Technical Regulations, Energy, etc.
    *   Upload and submission of accreditation attachments and files.

*   **Qualification of Employee Data:**

    *   Form submission capturing details of qualified employees aligning with regulatory criteria.

*   **Administrative Workflow:**

    *   Admin review of submissions with functionality to request additional data if required.
    *   Capability to return incomplete requests with notes for updates.

*   **Government Official Approval:**

    *   Final approval interface for government officials to validate and certify the request.
    *   Automated certificate generation upon successful approval.

*   **Data Storage and Management:**

    *   Recording of applicant details, regulatory data, approval history, submission and approval dates.
    *   Secure and traceable storage to support regulatory audits and compliance.

*   **Potential Future Integration Capability:**

    *   Basic architectural design to support future integration with the Saudi Business Center.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework:**

    *   Angular (for any potential frontend or admin dashboards).

*   **Backend Framework:**

    *   .NET Core 8.0.0 using the ABP framework to develop the RESTful API.

*   **Other Tools & Libraries:**

    *   Integration with tools like Cursor for advanced IDE support and real-time suggestions.

*   **AI Models/Libraries:**

    *   Although not directly required for certification process management, any future enhancements or integration with AI functionalities (for example, automated document classification) can leverage models such as GPT-4o.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The API should respond in under 300ms per request under normal load conditions to ensure smooth workflow processing.

*   **Security:**

    *   Ensuring that all data, especially sensitive applicant and approval history details, are stored securely with proper encryption.
    *   Role-based authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring only the right users access the appropriate endpoints.

*   **Compliance and Auditing:**

    *   The API must adhere to Saudi regulatory compliance standards, with traceable logs and audit trails for all transactions.

*   **Usability:**

    *   Clear and concise API endpoints with comprehensive documentation for ease of integration and maintenance.

*   **Scalability:**

    *   The architectural design should consider scaling out as the number of certificate requests increases.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The initial version will not include integration with the Saudi Business Center even though the architecture should allow for future expansion.
    *   The system relies on stable availability of the .NET Core 8.0.0 and ABP framework.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   It is assumed that users (government officials, business administrators, etc.) are familiar with the basic submission and review workflows.
    *   The underlying infrastructure (servers, cloud services) is provisioned to meet performance and security standards.
    *   All necessary regulatory information and lookups are pre-populated or provided via established data feeds.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Incomplete Data Submissions:**

    *   There is a risk of users submitting incomplete or incorrect data. Mitigation involves a robust feedback mechanism during the admin review stage.

*   **API Rate Limits and Load Management:**

    *   Potential bottlenecks during peak request times could affect response times. Implementing rate limiting and performance testing protocols early on is recommended.

*   **Future Integration Challenges:**

    *   Although integration with the Saudi Business Center is not in scope, future integration could require adherence to additional compliance and protocol standards. Preparing a modular design can help mitigate this.

*   **Role and Permission Misconfigurations:**

    *   Given the multi-stage approval process, any misconfiguration in role-based permissions can lead to delays or misrouted requests. Ensuring clear documentation and testing of role permissions is essential.

*   **Data Security and Compliance Risks:**

    *   Storing sensitive regulatory and applicant information requires careful compliance with data protection standards. Regular security audits and robust encryption measures are advised.
