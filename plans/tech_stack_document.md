# Tech Stack Document

## Introduction

The AcceptanceGate API is designed to automate and manage the acceptance certification process, ensuring that various regulatory requirements in Saudi Arabia are met. This system streamlines everything from certificate request submission and administrative reviews to the final government approval and certificate issuance. Our technology choices were made with reliability, security, and ease of use in mind, ensuring the project not only complies with regulations but also provides a seamless experience for government officials, business administrators, and other stakeholders.

## Frontend Technologies

For any potential administrative dashboards or user-facing interfaces, we are leveraging Angular due to its mature ecosystem and robust framework for building structured web applications. In addition, our project benefits from the CodeGuide Starter Pro kit, which incorporates Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. Next.js provides a modern framework that supports server-side rendering and efficient routing, resulting in dynamic, fast-loading pages. Tailwind CSS ensures that the design is both responsive and easy to maintain, while Shadcn UI provides pre-built components for a consistent look and feel. These frontend tools work together to offer a highly responsive and user-friendly interface, even though the core system is focused on API functionality.

## Backend Technologies

At the heart of the system is a robust backend powered by .NET Core 8.0.0 using the ABP framework with Modular architecture,

Domain-driven design principles,Comprehensive middleware support,Built-in dependency injection. This combination is chosen for its proven performance, scalability, and ability to enforce clean architectural practices. The API design follows RESTful principles to make it easy to manage the certification process, including submission of certificate requests, attachment uploads, and processing multi-stage approval workflows involving business administrators and government officials.

**Database**

* **Microsoft SQL Server**

* Robust data persistence

* Complex transaction support

* High-performance querying

* Data integrity enforcement

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The project is hosted on a reliable cloud platform designed to ensure high availability and scalability as demand grows. Our version control system is integrated with GitHub, and the CodeGuide Starter Pro repository serves as the base for our project, ensuring that all team members work on a unified codebase. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines are in place to allow rapid, safe, and automated updates to both the frontend and backend services. The advanced IDE, Cursor, is integrated into our workflow to provide real-time coding suggestions and enhanced developer support, ensuring that builds are stable and performance optimizations are consistently applied.

## Third-Party Integrations

While the primary focus of the system is on internal certification process management, we have designed our architecture with future integrations in mind. Although current project requirements do not call for direct integration with external systems like the Saudi Business Center, the system is capable of incorporating such integrations when needed. In addition, the use of Clerk Auth from the CodeGuide Starter Pro kit provides a secure and tested solution for user authentication. Other integrations from the starter kit, such as the Open AI model for potential automated processes, ensure that the system is well prepared for future enhancements and industry-standard third-party integrations without compromising the current functionality.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is built into every layer of the system. Role-based authentication and authorization are enforced through a combination of Clerk Auth and .NET Core’s robust security features. Sensitive data, including applicant details, approval histories, and regulatory information, is protected using industry-standard encryption and secure storage practices. The API is designed to respond quickly—keeping response times well under 300ms in regular operation—and additional performance optimizations, including caching strategies, are planned to handle peak loads. Through comprehensive audit trails and logging mechanisms, every step of the multi-stage acceptance process is recorded, ensuring both transparency and compliance with regulatory standards.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

This project’s tech stack is uniquely tailored to meet the stringent regulatory requirements of Saudi Arabia while providing a modern, user-friendly experience. The backend built on .NET Core 8.0.0 with the ABP framework ensures a reliable, scalable, and secure API, while Angular and the CodeGuide Starter Pro kit (comprising Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, Clerk Auth, and Open AI) deliver a powerful and appealing frontend experience. Together, these technologies support the entire lifecycle of certificate requests—from submission through to approval and final issuance—while maintaining a clear focus on security, performance, and ease of future integrations.
