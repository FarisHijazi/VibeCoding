# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

The AcceptanceGate API is a back-office system designed to automate and manage the acceptance certification process required by various regulatory bodies in Saudi Arabia. It plays a central role in ensuring that the entire process, from certificate request initiation to final issuance, is handled efficiently and accurately. This document explains how the backend is structured, how data flows through the system, and how key infrastructure components work together to support compliant and scalable operations.

## Backend Architecture

At the core of the system is a RESTful API built with .NET Core 8.0.0 using the ABP framework. This choice supports a modular architecture, domain-driven design, and robust middleware integration. The overall design focuses on clarity and separation of concerns. It uses established design patterns that allow the system to be easily scaled and maintained as the demand grows. Every component, including the workflow for certificate submission and approval, is structured in a way that enhances performance while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.

## Database Management

The system leverages Microsoft SQL Server to manage all data. This technology was chosen for its excellent support for complex transactions, data integrity, and high-performance querying. The database stores a variety of details such as applicant information, regulatory data, approval history, dates, and details of qualified employees. Data is structured in relational tables designed to relate certificate requests, user roles, and processing stages, ensuring that every piece of information is recorded consistently and securely for traceability and auditing purposes.

## API Design and Endpoints

The API is designed using RESTful principles, making it simple and flexible for both internal processes and future external integrations. Key endpoints include those for retrieving technical regulation lookup data, submitting certificate requests along with accreditation details, uploading necessary attachments, and recording employee qualification information. Additional endpoints support the administrative review process, allowing administrators to either approve requests or return them with feedback. Lastly, endpoints dedicated to government officials allow final review and confirmation before a certificate is generated and issued. This clear separation of endpoints makes sure the right data is accessible to the right user at the right time.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on a reliable and scalable cloud platform that ensures high availability and rapid performance. The chosen cloud provider offers robust support for containerized deployments, continuous integration and automated deployment workflows, and easy scaling as the number of certificate requests increases. The cloud environment is optimized for reliability and cost-effectiveness, providing a balance between using modern technologies and maintaining a secure infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Components

The backend infrastructure includes several key components that work together to optimize performance and user experience. A load balancer is used to distribute incoming requests efficiently across multiple backend servers. Caching mechanisms are implemented to reduce response times and lessen the load on the database during peak operations. In addition, although not currently active, the design allows for integration with content delivery networks (CDNs) to serve static content rapidly if needed in the future. Together, these components ensure that the API continues to deliver excellent performance even during high-demand periods.

## Security Measures

Security is a foundational element of the backend structure. Role-based authentication and authorization ensure that only the appropriate users can access specific endpoints; for example, only administrators and government officials have the permissions needed to approve certificate requests. Data transmission and storage are protected using industry-standard encryption practices and secure protocols. Sensitive aspects such as applicant details and regulatory data are securely stored in the database, and regular security audits are planned to ensure that these protections remain robust and compliant with government regulations.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To maintain top performance and continuous reliability, a variety of monitoring tools are employed. These tools offer real-time performance tracking, error logging, and alerting, so that any issues can be quickly identified and resolved. The system is also set up with automated deployment pipelines that facilitate regular updates and maintenance without causing major disruptions. Maintenance practices include routine security checks, regular performance optimizations, and systematic reviews of system logs to support both auditing and ongoing improvements.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend of the AcceptanceGate API is a thoughtfully designed and robust system that supports the entire certification process from start to finish. Built using .NET Core 8.0.0 with the ABP framework and supported by a Microsoft SQL Server database, the architecture is modular, scalable, and compliant with essential regulatory and security standards. With a clear RESTful API design, cloud hosting solutions, effective infrastructure components, and rigorous security and maintenance practices, this backend structure not only meets the project's current requirements but is also well-prepared for future enhancements and integrations. This comprehensive setup ensures that all stakeholders, including government officials and business administrators, have a reliable and transparent system to manage and audit certification processes.
