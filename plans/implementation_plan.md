## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Install .NET Core 8.0.0 (required for the backend) and verify by running `dotnet --version` (PRD Section 5, Tech Stack).
2.  Install the ABP CLI tools as specified by the ABP framework documentation for .NET Core 8.0.0 (PRD Section 5, Tech Stack).
3.  Install Angular CLI (latest stable version) to bootstrap the admin dashboard frontend (PRD Section 5, Tech Stack).
4.  Initialize a new Git repository with `main` and `dev` branches; set up branch protection rules in GitHub (PRD Section 1.4).
5.  **Validation**: Confirm .NET Core by `dotnet --version` and Angular CLI by `ng version`.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development (Angular Admin Dashboard)

1.  Create a new Angular project (if not already created) using `ng new acceptance-gate-admin` (PRD Section 1, Tech Stack).
2.  Generate the component for displaying the lookup list of technical regulations. Create `/src/app/certification-lookup.component.ts` using Angular CLI (`ng generate component certification-lookup`) (PRD Section 3, App Flow: User Lookup and Selection).
3.  Implement the form for the accreditation summary and file upload. Create `/src/app/accreditation-summary.component.ts` (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Accreditation Summary and Attachment Upload).
4.  Develop the form to capture the qualification details of the entity's employees. Create `/src/app/employee-qualification.component.ts` (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Qualification of Entity's Employees).
5.  Create an admin review dashboard component to list submitted requests and enable sending feedback. File path: `/src/app/admin-review.component.ts` (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Administrative Review and Feedback).
6.  Create a government official approval component to finalize and issue certificates. File path: `/src/app/govt-approval.component.ts` (PRD Section 3, App Flow: Government Officials Approval and Certificate Issuance).
7.  **Validation**: Run `ng test` to ensure all Angular components pass unit tests and have adequate coverage.

## Phase 3: Backend Development (.NET Core API with ABP Framework)

1.  Create a new .NET Core project using the ABP framework by running: `abp new AcceptanceGateApi -t app` (PRD Section 1, Tech Stack).

2.  In the project, add an endpoint to retrieve the lookup list of technical regulations. Create a controller file at `/Controllers/TechnicalRegulationsController.cs` with a GET method at route `/api/technical-regulations` (PRD Section 4, App Flow: User Lookup and Selection).

3.  Create an endpoint for submitting the accreditation summary and attachments. Implement a POST method in `/Controllers/CertificationsController.cs` at route `/api/certifications` (PRD Section 4, App Flow: Accreditation Summary and Attachment Upload).

4.  Create an endpoint to submit the qualification details of employees. Add a POST method in `/Controllers/EmployeeQualificationsController.cs` at route `/api/employee-qualifications` (PRD Section 4, App Flow: Qualification of Entity's Employees).

5.  Implement endpoints for administrative review actions:

    *   Add a GET method in `/Controllers/CertificationsController.cs` at route `/api/certifications/{id}` to fetch certification details.
    *   Add a POST method at route `/api/certifications/{id}/admin-approve` to allow admins to approve or return the request with feedback (PRD Section 4, App Flow: Administrative Review and Feedback).

6.  Implement an endpoint for government official approval: add a POST method in `/Controllers/CertificationsController.cs` at route `/api/certifications/{id}/govt-approve` (PRD Section 4, App Flow: Government Officials Approval and Certificate Issuance).

7.  Secure all endpoints with role-based authorization ensuring only designated roles (submitter, admin, government official) have access. Use ABP’s built-in authorization features (PRD Section 6, Non-Functional Requirements).

8.  **Validation**: Run integration tests (using tools such as Postman or the ABP testing suite) for each endpoint to ensure a 200 OK response and correct role restrictions.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  In the Angular project, create an HTTP service to communicate with the backend API. Create `/src/app/services/certification.service.ts` that uses Angular’s HttpClient to call endpoints (PRD Section 3, Overall System Integration and Storage).
2.  In the Angular components (steps 7–11), integrate API calls using the created service to submit forms and retrieve lookup data (PRD Section 3, App Flow details).
3.  Configure CORS in the .NET Core API to allow requests from `http://localhost:4200` by updating the middleware in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` (PRD Section 6, Non-Functional Requirements).
4.  **Validation**: Test the complete workflow end-to-end in a local environment by simulating a certificate submission and approval process.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Prepare a deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions (or your preferred CI/CD tool) to build and test both the Angular and .NET Core projects (PRD Section 7, Constraints & Assumptions).
2.  Configure deployment for the .NET Core API (e.g., deploy to an Azure App Service configured for .NET Core 8.0.0) and update the deployment scripts accordingly (PRD Section 2, Tech Stack).
3.  Build the Angular application and deploy it to a hosting service (e.g., Azure Static Web Apps or alternative cloud provider) (PRD Section 2, Tech Stack).
4.  Create and include configuration files (e.g., YAML for GitHub Actions) in the repository under `/infra/ci-cd.yaml` to automate deployment (PRD Section 7, Constraints & Assumptions).
5.  **Validation**: Run end-to-end tests (e.g., using Cypress or manual testing) against the production URLs of both the API and the frontend to ensure that the integrated system functions correctly.
