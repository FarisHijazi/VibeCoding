# Development Workflow
- Think step-by-step before coding, you may write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs outlining your approach.
- Create pseudocode/plan before implementation.
- Test after every meaningful change.
- Focus on complete core functionality first (zero TODOs/placeholders).
- Optimize only after achieving core functionality.
